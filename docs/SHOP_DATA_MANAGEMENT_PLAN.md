# Edinburgh Antiques Trail - Shop Data Management System

## Overview

This document outlines the design for a simple, fast, and accurate shop data management system for the Edinburgh Antiques Trail application. The system will initially be used by administrators for data entry but is designed to be extended for shop owner self-management in the future.

## Design Principles

1. **Simplicity** - Forms should be intuitive and straightforward for users with varying IT skill levels
2. **Accuracy** - Robust validation to prevent common data entry errors
3. **Efficiency** - Fast data entry with minimal steps and clear feedback
4. **Accessibility** - Design that accommodates users of all abilities
5. **Extensibility** - Architecture that supports future shop owner self-management

## System Components

### 1. Enhanced Form Components

These will replace the existing form components with improved versions that include:

- Built-in validation and error messaging
- Clear visual indicators for required fields
- Contextual help and tooltips
- Input masks for standardized data (phone numbers, emails, etc.)

### 2. Data Validation System

A comprehensive validation system that:

- Validates data in real-time as users type
- Provides specific, helpful error messages
- Prevents submission of invalid data
- Performs cross-field validation when appropriate
- Includes server-side validation for security

### 3. Shop Management Dashboard

A unified interface that:

- Shows all essential shop information at a glance
- Provides guided workflows for data entry and editing
- Includes batch operations where appropriate
- Offers visual confirmation of successful operations

### 4. Shop Owner Portal (Future)

A password-protected area where shop owners can:

- Update specific details about their shop
- Upload new images
- Modify hours and contact information
- Request approval for major changes

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Enhanced Form Components

1. Create enhanced form field components with built-in validation
2. Implement a form state management system
3. Add contextual help tooltips and error messages
4. Build responsive layouts for all screen sizes

### Phase 2: Validation Logic

1. Implement field-level validation rules
2. Create form-level validation for interdependent fields
3. Add API validation endpoints for complex checks
4. Build confirmation dialogs for potentially incorrect data

### Phase 3: Admin Dashboard Enhancement

1. Redesign shop list view with better filtering and sorting
2. Implement batch operations for common tasks
3. Add detailed audit logging for data changes
4. Create visual feedback system for form submission

### Phase 4: Shop Owner Portal (Future)

1. Build authentication and authorization system
2. Create limited-access forms for shop owners
3. Implement approval workflow for sensitive changes
4. Add notification system for pending changes

## UI Components Needed

1. **ValidationTextField** - Text input with built-in validation
2. **ValidationSelectField** - Dropdown with validation
3. **ValidationTextArea** - Multi-line text input with validation
4. **ImageUploader** - With preview and file validation
5. **LocationPicker** - Map interface with address autocomplete
6. **TimeRangePicker** - For business hours selection
7. **MultiStepForm** - For breaking complex forms into manageable steps
8. **ErrorSummary** - To display form errors in one place
9. **HelpTooltip** - For contextual help information
10. **FormSection** - For logical grouping of form fields
